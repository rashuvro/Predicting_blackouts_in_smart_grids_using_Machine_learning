# Predicting Cascading Failures in Smart Grids


Smart grids are complex systems where the demand-supply chain has to be maintained always between the generation of power, and the demand for power from the users to operate smart grids without interruptions. Although protective measures are in place, smart grids are prone to cascading failures. Cascading failures in the smart grids are scenarios where a small disturbance in the smart grid can create a domino effect due to an imbalance sudden between demand-supply. TThe number of people getting affected by these events and the economic loss is astronomical. In this project I have predicted cascading failures in smart grids using Machine learning algorithms. 

Summary of the project objective:
This project is a domain-specific research project and I will answer the following problems:
- First, perform exploratory data analysis to find the patterns in data, for example observing the role of various features like load-shedding, human error, etc. on cascading failure.
- Using regression techniques to find the effect of cascading failures due to various initiating disturbance conditions when cascading ends.
- Use classification techniques to identify the critical (leads to cascading failure) and non-critical (does not lead to cascading failure) initiating feature values.
- Do a comparison between various machine learning algorithms, do hyperparameter tuning where necessary.
